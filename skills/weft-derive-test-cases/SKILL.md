# Deriving an issue's test cases

Flow: **draft outline → enrich from code → independent adversarial review → clarify with the human → publish as a `test_cases` artifact**.

The artifact is the document's only home. It belongs to the issue, not to your
thread, so every fork of the lead sees the same one — and the human edits it
directly. Never duplicate the tree in prose: post the outline as chat while
drafting, but once published, the artifact is the source of truth.

## Where the document lives

Publish through the weft MCP tools, never by printing a marker for someone to
parse:

- `artifact_list` — does a `test_cases` artifact already exist for this issue?
- `artifact_read` — full content **and the current revision**.
- `artifact_write` — create (omit `id`) or revise (`id` + `expected_revision`).
- `artifact_status` — mark `ready` once the pre-finalize gate passes.

**Always read immediately before writing.** The human may have edited the
document since you last saw it, and a write carrying a stale `expected_revision`
is refused. When that happens you get back `revision_conflict` with the revision
that won: read it, re-apply your change on top of *their* version, and write
again. Never retry the same payload, and never overwrite an edit you have not
looked at.

Use `format: "markdown_tree"` — weft renders it as an editable mindmap.

## When not to do this

- The issue is trivial and fully specified — say so and move on.
- The human explicitly asked you to skip it — respect that without arguing.
- The human explicitly asked for it — do it even if the issue looks small.

## Non-negotiables

- A case is 「测什么 → 怎么操作 → 期望结果」, never a paraphrase of the
  requirement text.
- The tree speaks USER language: interactions and observable outcomes only.
  Translate every code finding into what a user would do or see.
- Every leaf is DECIDABLE: a concrete action plus an observable result.

## Workflow

1. **Profile the feature.** Switches/config, roles, special objects, single- vs
   multi-end, cross-end sync — the profile decides the tree's shape.
2. **Platform strategy.** One document by default. Split `pc端` / `移动端` under
   a node only where the gesture genuinely differs (hover vs long-press); only a
   fully divergent business flow justifies separate trees.
3. **First-level skeleton**, only for modules that actually exist — never pad:
   入口 → 开关/配置变更 → 核心功能流 → 特殊场景 → 异常与边界 → 兼容性.
4. **Fill each module.** Every core operation passes three coverages:
   - 功能路径: forward / reverse / boundary.
   - UI 交互路径: disabled states, click feedback, panel collapse, hover,
     long-press, soft keyboard, scrolling, focus.
   - 横切维度: permissions, multi-perspective views, copywriting, multi-end
     sync, concurrency, special objects, old-vs-new versions.
5. **Enrich from existing code** when the issue touches existing behaviour: real
   entries, hidden entries, compatibility risks. Every finding must be
   translated into a user-observable case before it enters the tree.
6. **Adversarial review — in a genuinely separate context.** See below.
7. **Draft in conversation first.** Post the outline and the open questions as
   plain chat. Any question that affects a behaviour judgement MUST be asked;
   guessing is not an option.
8. **Finalize.** Run both lints, then publish with `artifact_write` and set the
   status to `ready`.

## Step 6: the adversarial review must be independent

This is the step most easily faked. Re-reading your own tree and nodding at it
is not a review — you already believe it, so you will find nothing.

Independent means the reviewer starts from the requirement alone and has **not**
seen your reasoning:

- Preferred: spawn a sub-agent and give it only the requirement plus the tree.
- Otherwise: start a fresh context. State the requirement, paste the tree, and
  review without re-deriving — do not re-explain why you made each choice.

Attack three angles, and report findings even when there are none to report:

1. Cases missing or wrong versus the requirement.
2. UI interaction chains left incomplete.
3. Forward / reverse / boundary gaps.

Fold every finding into the tree or into the open-questions list.

## The two lints

Both run before `artifact_write`. A tree that fails either is not ready.

### Decidability lint

Every leaf names an action **and** an observable result. If two testers could
disagree about whether it passed, it fails.

| | |
|---|---|
| ✅ | 点击「保存」后,列表首行出现新建的草稿,标题为刚输入的文本 |
| ✅ | 未填写标题时点击「保存」,「保存」按钮保持禁用且不发起请求 |
| ❌ | 正常展示 |
| ❌ | 功能可用 |
| ❌ | 符合预期 |
| ❌ | 保存成功 |

The last one is the subtle failure: "保存成功" names an outcome but nothing
observable — success according to what? The fix is to say what the user sees.

### Tech-detail lint

No APIs, fields, SDKs, database tables, logs, or analytics events anywhere in
the tree. A code finding is fine as *input*; it must be translated before it
becomes a leaf.

| | |
|---|---|
| ✅ | 断网时点击「提交」,出现「网络异常,请重试」提示,已填内容不丢失 |
| ✅ | 从旧版本升级后打开列表,此前收藏的条目仍在且顺序不变 |
| ❌ | 调用 `POST /api/orders` 返回 500 时展示错误 |
| ❌ | `order_status` 字段为 `PENDING` 时按钮置灰 |
| ❌ | 上报 `click_submit` 埋点 |

Same shape each time: the ❌ rows name something only a developer can see. Ask
"could the tester observe this without opening the code or a console?" — if not,
rewrite it as what appears on screen.

## After the human edits

The human edits the artifact directly in weft, which bumps its revision. When
you next touch it, `artifact_read` first and carry their version forward. Only
re-publish when you are deliberately changing something, and say what you
changed and why — they are looking at the same document you are.
